.SH DESCRIPTION

is a keyboard\(hycentric, semidynamic tiling window manager for the X Window

.SS Window management
.B heawm
uses box as the building block to express hierarchy and layout of
windows. A box may contain further boxes or a client window, so that they form
a tree of boxes.
.PP
Children of a container box are dynamically tiled inside an automatic grid. The
dimensions of the grid (number of columns and rows) are automatically chosen to
provide a best-fit arrangement.
.PP
The maximum number of tiles appearing inside a grid can be limited, excluding
least recently used children. A box can be optionally cherry-picked and be
explicitly hidden or shown in the layout.
.PP
Floating boxes can be freely sized and always appear above tiled boxes.
.PP
When a floating box conceals more than one third of a just now focused tiled box it
is placed to an alternative position if possible.
.PP
Monitors are also floating boxes with a restriction that they cannot be
explicitly moved or resized by the user for obvious reasons.
.PP
Boxes can be addressed by their name that is shown at their label. Box labels
are circled with the color(s) of focusing hands.
